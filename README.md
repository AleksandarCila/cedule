## Technology

This lightweight web app features a fully responsive design, making it possible to use on both desktop and mobile devices. It is also available to be installed on your mobile device as a PWA.

Core of this app is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) which enabled an easy setup for both frontend and API backend. Storing all the data and authentication is done via serverless-mysql which connects to a MySQL database hosted on shared hosting.

[MUI](https://mui.com/) Component library is used to quickly develop and customize the UI. 

In order to keep this app lightweight and fast, [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) javascript library for date manipulation is used.

Whole project was written in TypeScript.
